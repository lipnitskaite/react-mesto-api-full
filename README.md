## Project Description

A project for the Yandex Practicum Web development course where I created an interactive SPA for sharing and liking photos.<br>

After the registration and authorisation users are redirected to the main page where they can see photos of other users and interact with them.<br>

It is a full-stack project, so I had an opportunity to practice both frontend and backend parts. One of the main challenges for me was figuring out how the authorisation process works, as well as how to update user's info.<br>

This project allowed me to dive deeper into React using states, hooks, and React's libraries, such as 'react-router' or 'react-email-validator'. I've also practiced JSX, CSS, and VanillaJS. The backend part is created using node.js, REST API, and MongoDB.<br>

### Mobile Support
